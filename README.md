# Shards of Dalaya Community Map Pack

This is a community map pack hosted on GitHub which allows for anyone to open pull requests to add their own unique maps labels.

This map pack does _not_ alter the base map layers which are edited and distributed via the Shards of Dalaya patcher.

## Installation
- Click the green button reading `Code` to open menu
- Select `Download ZIP` and save the `.zip` to an accessible area (desktop works)
- Open `shards_of_dalaya_maps.zip` and navigate to the `maps` directory
- Copy all contents within `maps` and paste within the `maps` directory in your Shards of Dalaya directory
    - For example: my directory is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Shards of Dalaya\maps`
- You may need to zone, camp out/back in, or reload the client to see the new map labels
